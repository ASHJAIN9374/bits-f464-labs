# Lab 1, Numpy and Vectorization

We will refer to [this](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/) book and try to cover it's Code Vectorization part extensively. <br>
This lab is motivated by 3 examples - 
- Uniform vectorization (through the game-of-life problem)
- Temporal Vectorization (by generating the Mandelbrot set of complex numbers)
- Spatial vectorization (by implementing boids)

Apart from this, we encourage you to go through <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06489.pdf">The Hardware Lottery </a>(especially section 3) to motivate this lab (purely for fun, like this lab xD).

### Take-home assignment - Implementing a vectorized 2D convolution!
